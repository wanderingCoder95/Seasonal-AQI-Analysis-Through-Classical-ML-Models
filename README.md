# 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **Air Quality Index (AQI) categories** using supervised machine learning models based on pollutant concentrations and contextual features such as **city** and **season**.

The objective was to build **accurate, robust, and interpretable models**, while performing comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics and validation techniques.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of air pollution measurements collected across multiple Indian cities (2015–2023), including:

### 🔹 Features

* **Pollutants:** PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃
* **Contextual:** City, Season (engineered from date)

### 🔹 Target

* AQI Category (Good, Satisfactory, Moderate, Poor, etc.)

### 🔹 Preprocessing Steps

* Handling missing values and validating imputation integrity
* Feature selection and consistency checks
* One-hot encoding of categorical variables
* Feature scaling (StandardScaler for SVM)
* Validation of physical constraints (e.g., PM2.5 ≤ PM10)
* Dataset standardization and cleaning

---

## ⚙️ Models Implemented

### 1️⃣ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

* Kernel: RBF
* Hyperparameters: C = 10, gamma = scale
* Applied on scaled features
* Achieved strong generalization and stable performance

---

### 2️⃣ Random Forest

* Ensemble-based classifier
* Low variance and strong stability
* Used for feature importance analysis

---

### 3️⃣ Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

* Indirect approach:

  * Predict AQI (numerical)
  * Map predictions → AQI categories
* High numerical performance but less suitable for classification

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

To ensure fair and reliable evaluation:

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, Macro F1-score
* Cohen’s Kappa (agreement beyond chance)
* Cross-validation (model stability)
* Train-Test Gap (overfitting detection)
* Feature Ablation (robustness testing)

---

## 🔬 Key Findings

* All models achieved **>98% accuracy**, indicating strong predictive features
* **SVM and Random Forest** showed stable performance with minimal overfitting
* **MLR achieved high scores** due to indirect prediction approach
* Feature ablation revealed:

  * Models do not rely on a single feature
  * Pollutants exhibit correlation and redundancy
  * Removing engineered features (e.g., PM2.5/PM10 ratio) improved performance

---

## 🏆 Final Model Selection

The **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** was selected as the final model because:

* Directly solves the classification problem
* High accuracy and Macro F1-score
* High Cohen’s Kappa (~0.97)
* Minimal overfitting (low train-test gap)
* Strong robustness under feature ablation

---

## 📊 Visualizations

* Model comparison charts (Accuracy, F1-score, Kappa)
* Confusion matrix (best model)
* PCA-based decision boundary visualization (SVM)
* Feature ablation comparison plots

---

## 🔍 Insights

* Accuracy alone is insufficient → multi-metric evaluation is essential
* Feature importance ≠ feature dependency
* Robust models maintain performance even after feature removal
* Direct classification models outperform indirect regression approaches

---

## 🚀 Future Work

* Integrate meteorological data (temperature, humidity, wind speed)
* Perform advanced hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
* Explore deep learning approaches
* Deploy as a real-time AQI prediction system

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
